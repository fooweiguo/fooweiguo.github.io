<h1>How to install SageMath in FreeBSD? </h1>

<p>As it is known, SageMath is not available in the FreeBSD repository. But there is a fix! Just like WSL for Windows, we have something similar for FreeBSD called the <a href="https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/linuxemu/"> Linux Binary Compatibility</a>. It simply uses the chroot techology to run Linux binaries in the FreeBSD environment. This is the beauty of POSIX standard. I would recommend installing Ubuntu using the "debootstrap" command on the empty folder /compat/ubuntu. </p>

<p> After following the instructions there, you will most likely run the command "chroot /compat/ubuntu /bin/bash" which will bring you to the Linux substation and you can modify your home folder there! Then you run as root "apt-get install  sagemath sagemath-doc-en sagemath-jupyter". The installation will probably take up 5GB of space. You will also need to install a browser. For instance "apt install firefox". Afterwhich you will run </p>

<p> sage -n jupyter --allow-root </p>

<p> To run as root in the chroot-ed environment sagemath jupyter. Because xorg will not run on this chroot environment, you will not be able to launch firefox from there but instead, copy the localhost IP address into your **host** browser and you can use sagemath from there! </p>
